## Credits

### Code Used

- Code came from a tutorial on YouTube that I followed. Only nine days to learn Python and create a project isn't enough time for me to do it all on my own. 
 - [12 beginner Python projects from freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg)
 
- The Readme template came orginally from [Kera Cudmore](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/readme-examples/blob/main/milestone1-readme.md) but changes with every project.
